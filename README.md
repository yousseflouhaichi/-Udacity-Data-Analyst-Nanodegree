# [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)
This repository contains all projects needed to complete Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.


## Project Overview
### P1: Investigate a Dataset (Medical Appointment No Shows dataset)

This project focused on the data analysis process as whole. 
Everything was covered, including data gathering, cleaning, assessing, exploring and visualizing. Insights where communicated throughout the process.  
This project included therefore all steps of the typical data analysis process. This includes:
- posing questions
- gather, wrangle and clean data 
- communicate answers to the questions 
- assited through visualizations and statistics. 

The main objective was to identify the characteristics of patients who miss their appointments through examining information about 100k patients.
### P2: Wrangle and Analyze Data (WeRateDogsâ„¢ (@dog_rates))

This project was a deep dive into the data wrangling part of the data analysis process as we had to deal with the reality of dirty and messy data. First we started with gathering data from different sources including the Twitter API, identified issues with the dataset in terms of tidiness and quality. Afterwards we had to solve these problems while documenting each step. The end of the project was then focused on the exploration of the data.
The key findings of the project as well as the performed efforts were clearly detailed in 2 separate reports.

### P3: Communicate Data Findings (Student Performance)

The task of this final project was to analyze and visualize real-world data while using sophisticated techniques and going through uni-, bi- and multivariate visualizations.
I chose to work on the Student Performance in exams dataset in order to  identify the characteristics of the most successful students.
